'''

You will be given a grid line by line. And each cell is either a "." or "W" (wall).
For each cell calculate the length of the shortest path from (0,0) (upper left corner) to
    the cell. And then print out the distances in the same grid format. 
    If there is no path, print -1 for that cell.
